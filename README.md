# Foodpanda Capstone

## Topic

Voucher

- The food delivery process consists of users picking their meals, collecting the order into a basket and then confirming payment during the checkout process.
- Build a system that that implements Voucher functionality. The company needs to be able to create, manage vouchers (amounts, %-ages, expiry dates); and to distribute them to our users.
- Further, we also need to enable the user to later apply the voucher during the checkout process.

2. deploy branch :point_right: Deployment

   Only **rebase** to **_deploy branch_** when a feature has been completed.

- Always create a new branch when implementing a new feature

```
git checkout -b <branch name> ðŸ‘‰ If the branch doesn't exist
git switch <branch name> ðŸ‘‰ If the branch exists
```

- Commit with a short message and detailed description

```
Always commit with small changes, not with large changes
git commit -m "short message" -m "detailed description"
```

- Create a new pull request when a feature is completed

  Do it via GitHub desktop website, submit a pull request for everyone to review
