## Context

We decided to create an admin portal that allows user to use the following features with relative ease.

1. A data table that displays all the vouchers
2. **Create** new voucher for the system
3. **Update** any existing vouchers
4. **Delete** any existing vouchers
5. A dummy checkout page to show that the vouchers can be applied

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/ 'MongoDB official site') is currently our choice of database and we are calling REST API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on it.
- Click here to access the backend repository (Created by [@nicholas5538](https://github.com/nicholas5538)), built with `Node.js`, `TypeScript` and `mongoose`.
  > Backend repository is currently private as proper documentation of the API endpoints is not completed.


## Quick Link

- [Production Deployment](https://fp-capstone-voucher-78842.web.app/ 'Production deployment URL')

  > Any changes that are merged / pushed to the `main` branch, will be deployed to **_Production_**.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

- Add a new SSH key to your GitHub account. [Instructions to how to generate](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account 'Generate SSH key').

- Install any version of node that is >= 14.0.0.

  > üíÅ **Tip:** You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm 'nvm repo') to easily manage multiple versions of node. Once installed, run `nvm use` in the project directory.

- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (We're currently using pnpm [v8.7.0](https://github.com/nicholas5538/fp-capstone/blob/main/.yarn/releases/yarn-3.5.0.cjs) for this project)

  > üíÅ `npm install -g pnpm`

### Repository Setup

Once you have your SSH key added and environment setup, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:nicholas5538/fp-capstone.git
cd fp-capstone
pnpm i
```

## Developing

Once you have [set up the repo](#repository-setup), you're ready to start developing. Starting the development environment is managed by the following command.

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

The `dev` command will start the application in your local environment (port 5173).

### Frequently Used Scripts

In addition to the `dev` command, there are other scripts available in the package.json. Some of the most common you might get to use are:

- `pnpm run format` - Check prettier formatting through all the codes

  > üíÅ **Tip:** use `pnpm run format:fix` to run auto prettier formatting across all the codes

- `pnpm run lint` - Runs TS linter through all the codes
