### Backend
**_ TBC _**

### Version 1
Admin-only access: 
- CRUD - Voucher

Customer access:

1. Read, Delete - Voucher
2. Voucher Type (Pick-up / Delivery)

Flow of our project
1. A page for admins to perform create, read, update or delete vouchers
2. Dummy checkout page (visible to both admin and customer)
> Just to show that voucher can be selected and applied from the customer perspective
> Might want to add filtering either on the frontend or backend side

### Version 2
Additional features if time permits:
- Separate pages for admin and customer
