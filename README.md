## Context

We decided to create an admin portal that allows user to use the following features with relative ease.

1. A data table that displays all the vouchers
2. **Create** new voucher for the system
3. **Update** any existing vouchers
4. **Delete** any existing vouchers
5. A dummy checkout page to show that the vouchers can be applied

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

- Add a new SSH key to your GitHub account. [Instructions to how to generate](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

- Install any version of node that is > 10.0.0.

  > üíÅ **Tip:** You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily manage multiple versions of node. Once installed, run `nvm use` in the project directory.

- Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) (We're currently using yarn [v3.5.0](https://github.com/nicholas5538/fp-capstone/tree/main/frontend-voucher/.yarn/releases) for this project)

  > üíÅ `npm install --global yarn`

### Repository Setup

Once you have your SSH key added and environment setup, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:nicholas5538/fp-capstone.git
cd frontend-voucher
yarn install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed. you are required create a `.env` file under `frontend-voucher` folder and insert the following codes.
**_TAKE NOTE: please request for tokens either from [@nicholas5538](https://github.com/nicholas5538 "nicholas5538 profile") or [@Rychua002](https://github.com/Rychua002 "Rychua002 profile")._**

```
VITE_SHEET_DB_ID=<insert voucher sheet token here>
VITE_SHEET_DB_TOKEN=<insert voucher sheet bearer token here>
VITE_SHEET_ARCHIVE_ID=<insert archive sheet token here>
VITE_SHEET_ARCHIVE_TOKEN=<insert archive sheet api bearer token here>
```

## Developing

Once you have [set up the repo](#repository-setup), you're ready to start developing. Starting the development environment is managed by the following command.

```sh
yarn dev
```

The `dev` command will start the application in your local environment (port 5173).

### Frequently Used Scripts

In addition to the `dev` command, there are other scripts available in the package.json. Some of the most common you might get to use are:

- `yarn format` - Check prettier formatting through all the codes

  > üíÅ **Tip:** use `yarn format:fix` to run auto prettier formatting across all the codes

- `yarn lint` - Runs TS linter through all the codes
