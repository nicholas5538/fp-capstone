# Foodpanda Capstone

## Topic
Voucher
* The food delivery process consists of users picking their meals, collecting the order into a basket and then confirming payment during the checkout process.
* Build a system that that implements Voucher functionality. The company needs to be able to create, manage vouchers (amounts, %-ages, expiry dates); and to distribute them to our users.
* Further, we also need to enable the user to later apply the voucher during the checkout process.
